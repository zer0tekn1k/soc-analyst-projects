# \# 🛡️ SOC Analyst \& Blue Team Projects

# 

# Hands-on security projects simulating real-world SOC, detection engineering, and investigation workflows.

# 

# This repository showcases how I think through alerts, logs, and incidents — focusing on \*\*practical detection logic\*\*, \*\*clear investigation narratives\*\*, and \*\*automation-friendly outputs\*\*.

# 

# \### 1️⃣ Suspicious Login Story Builder

# \*\*Focus:\*\* Authentication anomaly detection \& SOC investigation  

# \*\*Skills:\*\* Behavioral baselining, risk scoring, alert storytelling, JSON automation

# 

# \*\*What it does:\*\*

# \- Establishes baseline login behavior from historical data

# \- Detects anomalous authentication events using:

# &nbsp; - New geography

# &nbsp; - New device

# &nbsp; - Unusual login time

# &nbsp; - Short suspicious sequences (success → failure)

# \- Outputs:

# &nbsp; - Analyst-readable incident narratives

# &nbsp; - JSON output for automation or SIEM ingestion

# \## 🧠 What This Repo Demonstrates

# 

# \- SOC Tier 1–2 alert triage thinking

# \- Blue Team detection logic (behavior-based, not signature-only)

# \- Clear documentation and investigation reasoning

# \- Clean Git workflow with incremental, meaningful commits

#

# 

# \## 🛠️ Tools \& Technologies

# \- Python

# \- CSV log analysis

# \- Git \& GitHub

# \- Command-line tooling
